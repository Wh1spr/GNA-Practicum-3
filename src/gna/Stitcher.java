	 * Positions that are diagonally adjacent are considered adjacent.

	 * image1 and image2 are both non-null and have equal dimensions.

	 * 
	 *   The historical reasons behind using this layout is explained on the following
	 *   website: http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=introduction_to_graphics
	 * 
	 *   Position (y, x) corresponds to the pixels image1[y][x] and image2[y][x]. This
	 *   convention also means that, when an automated test mentioned that it used the array
	 *   {{A,B},{C,D}} as a test image, this corresponds to the image layout as shown in
	 *   the illustration above.

	 * algorithm must replace all Stitch.EMPTY values with either Stitch.IMAGE1 or Stitch.IMAGE2.
	 *
	 * Positions left to the seam should contain Stitch.IMAGE1, and those right to the seam
